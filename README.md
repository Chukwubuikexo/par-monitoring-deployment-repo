Analyzing Schema  - On downloading the csv files, i set to cleaning the data set, filling or wrong missing values and setting the type accordingly (currency, text, data/time), . From my analysis, I considered a STAR schema best for the data modelling, hence i created a new fact table as it is central in a star schema and stores the measurable events (facts) that for analysis. 
This restructuring facilitates analytical queries, particularly for calculating metrics like Payment at Risk (PAR).
In calculating the PAR Days the loan payments table is allows One loan for one or multiple payments, hence i removed existing primary key in Fact_loan table for a new composite primary key to address duplicates in loan_id column.
