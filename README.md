Analyzing Schema  - On downloading the csv files, i set to cleaning the data set, filling or wrong missing values and setting the type accordingly (currency, text, data/time), removing duplicates in loan_id column. From my analysis, I considered a STAR schema best for the data modelling, hence i created a new fact table as it is central in a star schema and stores the measurable events (facts) that for analysi. This restructuring facilitates analytical queries, particularly for calculating metrics like Payment at Risk (PAR).
